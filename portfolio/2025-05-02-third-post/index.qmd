Here is my first dynamic quarto It was created using [Wellcome 2018 data](https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018). Just like the static dashboard, it features two pages, each with a variety of graphs and value cards. Now, you have the ability to change the first-page value cards for comparison-sake, and change the number of grouping colors on the chloropleth.
